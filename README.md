Man Calc (manual calculator) is a stack-based calculator for
iOS that can deal with very large or very small numbers
(around 1000 decimal places of precision), and supports both
infix and postfix syntax. Here are some examples. Type the
stuff on the left. The symbol ↩ means "press enter" and the
symbol ← means press delete". The following line shows the
resulting stack between the square braces. The rightmost
value in the stack is the result of the most recent
operation.
